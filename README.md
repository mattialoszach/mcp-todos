# 📝 MCP ToDo Server
A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for managing ToDos. Easily integrated into the Claude Desktop environment or used standalone with mcp dev. Built with simplicity, persistence, and user-guided interaction in mind.

## ✨ Features
- Add, list, complete, and delete ToDos via AI commands
- JSON file-based persistence in a dedicated Data/ folder
- Natural-language prompt for summarizing all ToDos
- Ready-to-use with Claude Desktop (via mcp install) or mcp dev

## 🚀 Quick Start
### 📦 Installation
It is recommended using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), so make sure you have **uv** installed. Generally, for more information regarding MCP checkout [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

Clone this repo then:
```bash
uv sync
```

### ▶️ Running the Server
With uv:
```bash
uv run mcp install server.py
```
Or directly:
```bash
mcp install server.py
```
To test in development mode with logging:
```bash
mcp dev server.py
```
> [!NOTE]
> 🧠 Note: When using Claude Desktop, ensure the app is properly restarted after installing a new server.
